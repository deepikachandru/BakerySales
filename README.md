BakerySales and weather impact- NICD assessment
This preoject presents an analysis and forecasting model aimed at helping a bakery in France optimize its daily production. The goal is to reduce waste and ensure that customers always have access to fresh products. The analysis leverages two datasets: 'bakery_sales.csv' and 'weather_2021.01.01-2022.10.31.csv'. By combining sales data with weather statistics, an accurate forecasting model is developed to provide actionable insights.
